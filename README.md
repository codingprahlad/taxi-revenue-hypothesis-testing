# 🚖 Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Drivers using Hypothesis Testing

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes taxi trip data to understand whether **payment
type (Cash vs Card)** has a significant impact on **fare amount** and
driver revenue. Using data analysis and hypothesis testing, the goal is
to identify patterns that can help taxi drivers and companies maximize
earnings.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **data cleaning,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical hypothesis testing**
using Python.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In the taxi industry, maximizing driver revenue is essential for
sustainability and driver satisfaction. Payment methods may influence
customer spending behavior, which in turn affects total fare amounts.

This project investigates:

> **Does payment type (cash or card) significantly affect the total fare
> amount?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ❓ Research Questions

-   Is there a relationship between **payment type** and **fare
    amount?**\
-   Can encouraging certain payment methods help drivers earn higher
    revenue?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Objectives

-   Perform data cleaning and preprocessing\
-   Conduct exploratory data analysis\
-   Compare fare amounts across payment types\
-   Apply hypothesis testing (A/B testing approach)\
-   Draw data-driven conclusions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains taxi trip records including:

-   Passenger count\
-   Trip distance\
-   Trip duration\
-   Payment type\
-   Fare amount

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

-   Removed irrelevant columns\
-   Filtered payment types to only **Cash (2)** and **Card (1)**\
-   Removed trips with:
    -   0 passengers\
    -   Negative fare, distance, or duration\
-   Handled outliers for better accuracy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Distribution analysis of fare amounts\
-   Passenger behavior study\
-   Payment method proportions\
-   Visualizations using charts

### 2️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

A statistical test was used to determine if the difference in fare
amounts between cash and card payments is significant.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**\
There is no significant difference in fare amounts between cash and card
payments.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**\
There is a significant difference in fare amounts between cash and card
payments.
