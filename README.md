# 🚕 Hypothesis Testing: Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Drivers

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes taxi trip data to understand how different payment
methods (cash vs card) impact fare amounts and overall revenue. Using
hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis, I investigated whether
payment type influences how much drivers earn per trip. The goal is to
provide data-driven insights that can help taxi drivers and companies
make better business decisions.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In the taxi industry, maximizing revenue is important for both drivers
and service providers. Payment methods may influence customer behavior
and fare amounts, but this relationship is often unclear.

In this project, I explored whether payment type (cash or card) has a
significant effect on fare prices. By applying hypothesis testing and
data analysis techniques, I aimed to determine if one payment method
leads to higher average fares. The findings can help drivers and
companies optimize revenue strategies.
